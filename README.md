The aim of this excercise is to create a list of addresses with First Name, Last name, email and address.

The mock data is already provided in folder src/data/mock_data.json

- An item can have a maximum of 5 tags and should be removable, but not editable.

- Each item in the list should display at least the First Name, Last name, email and address.

- Tags should be persisted so that the tags remain across browser sessions.

- The list should also be filterable by user defined tags through a simple search.

- You must create the UI components yourself and feel free to use third party libraries such as Material UI.

- Once session is maintained, the app updates the tags (addition and deletion) through sessionStorge.

- Searching on the top input filters the items by tag names

- Searching an unvailable tag results in a "No results found with keyword" error.

- Searching also updates the number of items displayed saying, "Showing n of 200", when it finds the keywords.

BONUS - Add tag button and Enter a tag name input disables after 5 entries per item.

- Validation added on the Enter tag input field ("Input can't be empty") so no empty string can be added.
